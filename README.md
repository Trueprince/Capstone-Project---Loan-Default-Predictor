# Capstone-Project---Loan-Default-Predictor
This project aimed to develop a robust predictive model for loan default prediction, leveraging machine learning techniques to improve financial decision-making processes. The primary goal was to identify key risk factors associated with loan default and to build a model that could accurately predict default probabilities for new applicants.
